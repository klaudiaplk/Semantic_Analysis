The UK is rolling out a vaccination programme for COVID-19. This programme has identified priority groups and aims to offer vaccination to all adults. Here are some of the frequently asked questions we received about the coronavirus vaccine and the vaccination programme
@bbbykess @ZubyMusic @EmmanuelXLI It's most likely that science will confirm that specifically that Corona Virus can't be spread by vaccinated people. But scientific proof takes time which is a fact I hate too. The best evidence would be positive cases going down but vaccination is going way to slow... 🙄
